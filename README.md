# Introduction 
Formula 1 (F1) is an elite motorsport that produces a wealth of data, encompassing everything from car telemetry to driver statistics and race outcomes. This project leverages advanced data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from F1 data, with the goal of enhancing team performance, refining race strategies, and improving overall results.
This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis of Formula One data, current up to the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix. The analysis is conducted using Python, employing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process and visualize the data effectively.
By diving deep into this rich dataset, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can provide a competitive edge in the high-stakes world of Formula 1 racing. This project offers a fascinating exploration of how data science can be applied to one of the world's most technologically advanced sports.

# Data Source
This analysis utilises a comprehensive Formula 1 dataset sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science projects and competitions. The dataset encompasses a wealth of information on F1 drivers, including details about their career spans, race performances, and championship points accumulated. It provides a rich resource for exploring various aspects of Formula 1 racing history and driver statistics.

# Data Cleansing 
In preparing the dataset for analysis, I encountered various challenges with data quality and consistency. To address these issues, I implemented a comprehensive data cleaning process using the Pandas library.
Initially, I examined the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies in data types. Using Pandas, I methodically removed or imputed missing values as appropriate, and converted data types to ensure they were suitable for my intended analyses.

# Data Analysis 
I conducted a thorough analysis of the data to uncover insights and address several key questions pertaining to Formula 1 racing. My approach incorporated correlation analysis and data visualisation, utilising the Matplotlib library.
In this study, I explored the following questions:

1 - How are driver nationalities distributed within this dataset?
2 - To what extent does the number of seasons a driver competes correlate with their race win tally?
3 - For drivers who have achieved champion status, what is the relationship between their podium finishes and pole positions?
4 - What factors contribute significantly to a driver becoming a champion?

My analysis employed various statistical techniques and graphical representations to elucidate patterns and relationships within the data, providing a comprehensive view of Formula 1 driver performance and success factors.
